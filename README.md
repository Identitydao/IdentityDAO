# IdentityDAO

## Description

**IdentityDAO** is a decentralized identity management platform that empowers individuals to have full control over their digital identity. It utilizes Web3 technologies to facilitate secure, private, and self-sovereign identity management, allowing users to authenticate without relying on centralized entities.

This project is built around a community-driven **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)**, where stakeholders can participate in governance and decision-making processes.

## Features

- **Decentralized Identity Management**: Users fully control their digital identities, reducing reliance on centralized systems.
